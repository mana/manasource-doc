#  Quality insurance

In order to keep a minimum level of software development quality, here are simple points one should try to follow
when willing to do 'perfect commits':

 * Every commits should follow entirely the [Hacking](hacking.html) convention when possible.
 * Commits should be reviewed by another developers and questions should cleared out before committing.
 * The problem should be fully understood before committing. Obvious isn't it ;)
 * Commits should be clearly summarized in the message's first line for better readability. <br /> Lines after that should explain the problem and how it is, even partially, fixed. Known regressions or bugs still here should also be given.
 * For sensitive code parts, [use cases](use_cases.html) should be provided before or with patches in order to permit other developers to play with it before committing.
 * Make use of common sense!
