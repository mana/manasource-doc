====== Quality insurance ======

In order to keep a minimum level of software development quality, here are simple points one should try to follow
when willing to do 'perfect commits':

  * Every commits should follow entirely the [[Hacking]] convention when possible.
  * Commits should be reviewed by another developers and questions should cleared out before committing.
  * The problem should be fully understood before committing. Obvious isn't it ;)
  * Commits should be clearly summarized in the message's first line for better readability. \\ Lines after that should explain the problem and how it is, even partially, fixed. Known regressions or bugs still here should also be given.
  * For sensitive code parts, [[use cases]] should be provided before or with patches in order to permit other developers to play with it before committing. 
  * Make use of common sense!
