====== Mana Server Configuration ======

This article is about setting up your own Mana server.

==== Running the Example ====

There is a small example world and an example configuration file provided with manaserv that allows you to quickly get started. The needed steps to get it running are:

  * [[Database Installation|Install]] or [[upgrade database|upgrade]] your database backend.

  * Copy the ''docs/manaserv.xml.example'' file to ''./manaserv.xml''.

  * Start the account server and the game server (the order doesn't matter).

**Note:** you can use the ''--config'' option to set where your ''manaserv.xml'' file is located. By default the server looks for ''./manaserv.xml''. E.g.:

  manaserv-game --config /path/to/my/manaserv.xml

**Tip:** Type ''manaserv-account --help'' and ''manaserv-game --help'' to get the list of available options.

==== Server and World Configuration ====

The server is configured in [[manaserv.xml]]. The world has its own [[settings:settings.xml]] file that defines the maps, NPCs, monsters, items, etc. in your world. Most of these settings are also used by the client.

==== Making yourself a GM ====

=== For SQLite database users (the default) ===

  * Install the sqlite3 command line tool (for example from http://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
  * Open a command prompt inside the manaserv directory
  * Enter ''sqlite3 mana.db "UPDATE mana_accounts SET level=255 WHERE username='MyAccount';"''
  * You can check if you were successful by entering ''sqlite3 mana.db "SELECT username, level FROM mana_accounts;"'' (lists all accounts and their userlevels) or ''sqlite3 mana.db "SELECT username FROM mana_accounts WHERE level > 1;"'' (lists all GM accounts)

=== For MySQL database users ===

  * Log in to your MySQL server, using a shell command for instance: \\
  mysql --user=<user> --password=<password> --hostname=<hostname> --port=<port>
  * Choose the database: ''use <my-database-name>;''
  * Then, you can enter the SQL requests: ''"UPDATE mana_accounts SET level=255 WHERE username='MyAccount';"''
  * You can check if you were successful by entering ''"SELECT username, level FROM mana_accounts;"'' (lists all accounts and their userlevels) or ''"SELECT username FROM mana_accounts WHERE level > 1;"'' (lists all GM accounts)

=== For PostgreSQL database users ===

FIXME: This is to be done.

**Note:** The level 255 means maximum rights. When you want to give selected people limited rights, refer to the [[permissions.xml]] file configuration.

Basic knowledge of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL|SQL]] and [[http://sqlzoo.net/|how to use it]] is an important skill for a Mana server administrator.
