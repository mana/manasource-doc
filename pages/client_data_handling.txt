A MMORPG client such as the Mana client needs manage a lot of data. Mana tries to remain flexible, but easy to use, for server maintainers to make and maintain client data.

====== Data locations ======

Mana will load data from several places. Each has it's own purpose. Depending on the operating system, the Mana client won't locate its data in the same place, here is where each data type is stored, depending on the main supported OSes. '%appShort%' is a branding value (of the same name, taken from the [[branding.xml|branding file]], if provided) used to provide branding-specific locations for certain settings.

^ Path type ^ Operating System ^^^
^ ::: ^ Linux and Posix ^ Mac ^ Windows ^
^ User base directory \\ //(also known as ~)// | /home/<user> | /Users/<user> | %USER_PROFILE% \\ C:\Windows\Profiles\<user> (on Win98/Me) \\ C:\WinNT\Profiles\<user> (on WinNT) \\ C:\Documents and Settings\<user> (WinXP) \\ C:\Users\<user> (on Win7) \\ //(Based on a Windows installation made on the C: drive.)// |
^ User config directory | ~/.config/mana/%appShort% | ~/Library/Application Support/mana/%appShort% | Roaming application profile\Mana\%appShort% |
^ User data directory \\ //(updates, logs, etc)// | ~/.local/share/mana | ::: | Local application profile\Mana |
^ User screenshot directory \\ //(can be changed by the user)// | ~/Desktop (or ~ if it fails) |||

====== Loading order ======

Client data is loaded from several sources into [[PhysFS]]. When the client is started, the following folders are added in order (later takes precedence):
  - application installation path
  - run/working directory
  - -d/--data from 'command line' options

After the client logs in to a server and [[update system|updates]] are loaded, the following data sources are loaded:
  - [[update system|updates files]]
  - custom data in the config/%appShort%/customData folder (zip files only; order undetermined)

====== Required data ======
The client requires that several pieces of data are in specific locations. Some is distributed with the client, others need to be provided by branding or updates. Data included with the client sources:

^ Folder ^ Description ^
| fonts | Font files. |
| graphics/gui | Default [[gui configuration|GUI theme]] (gray). |
| graphics/images | error.png and [[wallpaper]]. |
| help | Help files. |
| icons | Icons files. Different formats are provided for different OSes. |

The following files and folders are required by the client but not included with the client sources (as they are world-specific). Subfolders for files not listed are usable and recommended. The file types given are the types that need to go in the folders (ex: images for sprites can be anywhere, but their XML needs to be in graphics/sprites). The table:
