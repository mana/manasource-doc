===== manaserv.xml file configuration =====
Data from the ''manaserv.xml'' file or ''.manaserv.xml'' store central configuration values for the account and the game servers.
Each configuration option is defined using an <option> tag within the <configuration> main node, for instance:

<file xml manaserv.xml sample>
 <?xml version="1.0"?>
 <configuration>
    <option name="net_accountServerAddress" value="localhost"/>
    <option name="net_accountServerPort" value="9601"/>
 </configuration>
</file>

**Important Note:** Each and every option names are **__case-sensitive__** in the server!! (This is linked to computation-saving and simplification purpose.)
