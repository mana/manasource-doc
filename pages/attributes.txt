====== Description ======
Attributes are basically variables of beings. They can determinate things like HP, Movement speed, ...

An attribute consists of two values. A base value and a modified value.

===== base - value =====
Each attribute has a *base value*. This value for example determines the current HP of a being.

===== modifier - value(s) =====
Then every attribute can have multiple *modifiers*. Modifiers are a bit more complex. They are basically **layers** that define how bonuses are added to the base value. The layers themselves contain the actual modifications like item bonuses, status effect bonuses, and so on. So if you have an item that changes an attribute you likely want to make it modify one of the modifier layers.

Modifiers can either be ''additive'' or ''multiplicative''. Additive modifiers simply add up like this:
<code>previousLayers + currentLayer</code>

Multiplicative modifiers work analogous to the additive ones:
<code>previousLayers * currentLayer</code>

There are three different kinds of modifiers:
== stackable - modifier ==
The stackable modifier is really simple. It simply sums (or multiplies) all modifications in this layer and adds (or multiplies) to the value of the previous layer.

== non stackable - modifier ==
From all modifications inside of a non stackable modifier layer only the best (highest) modification is picked. If this modification is higher then the previous layers it will replace the previous layers with this value. Otherwise nothing happens and the previous layers stay untouched. Of course using ''multiplicative'' makes no sense since it only replaces previous values.

== non stackable bonus - modifier ==
The non stackable bonus works similar to the non stackable one. It will pick the best modification within the layer too. But it won't replace the previous layers but add (or multiply) to them. However it will **also** add if the modification would lower the value of the previous layers (**unlike** the non stackable modifier)!

==== Example calculation ====
Lets assume the following situation:

The base of the attribute is 

There are 3 modifiers:
^  Name (tag)  ^  Stacktype            ^  Effecttype      ^  Active modifications withing the layer  ^
|  example1    |  stackable            |  multiplicative  |  ''{1.3; 0.9; 1.1}''                     |
|  example2    |  non stackable        |  additive        |  ''{10.0; 3.0; 1.0}''                    |
|  example3    |  non stackable bonus  |  additive        |  ''{2.0; 3.4; 5.1}''                     |

And lets assume the base as ''9.0'':
<code>
current = 9.0

apply example1:
    # Since the layer is stackable and multiplicative all will be simply multiplied:
    mod_example1 = 1.3 * 0.9 * 1.1
    current = current * mod_example

# current is 11.583 (9 * 1.3 * 0.9 * 1.1)

apply example2:
    # Since the layer is non stackable we only have to check for the highest value:
    mod_example2 = 10.0
    
    If current < mod_example2 Then
        current = mod_example2
        
# current is still 11.583 since 10.0 was smaller than it

apply example3:
    # Since the layer is non stackable bonus we only have to check for the highest value:
    mod_example3 = 5.1
    # Since type is additive we simply add this to the previous value:
    current = current + mod_example3

# current is 16.683 ((9 * 1.3 * 0.9 * 1.1) + 5.1)
</code>

So our actual attribute value will be 16.683.

FIXME: Check if non stackable really replaces the base value too

===== storage in database =====
The database saves both the base + the sum of modification of all modifiers. However the game server will never use the stored modification. It will always recalculate it. So there is no need to worry about changing the database when modifying attribute mods in the items.xml for example. However be careful with setting the base attribute in scripts since it will be persistent.

===== Dependencies between attributes =====
You will most likely want to have multiple attributes that depend on each other
or change others. To implement this you have to do the recalculation in your
scripts.

To do this you have two callbacks which will tell you when you need to do
recalculations:
  * [[scripting#on_update_derived_attribute|on_update_derived_attribute]]
  * [[scripting#on_recalculate_base_attribute|on_recalculate_base_attribute]]

Here is an example that shows how this recalculation could look like:

<file lua attributes.lua>
local function recalculate_base_attribute(being, attribute)
    local old_base = being_get_base_attribute(being, attribute)
    local new_base = old_base
    if attribute == ATTR_ACCURACY then
        -- Provisional
        new_base = being_get_modified_attribute(being, ATTR_DEX)
    elseif attribute == ATTR_DEFENSE then
        new_base = 0.3 * being_get_modified_attribute(being, ATTR_VIT)
    elseif attribute == ATTR_DODGE then
        -- Provisional
        new_base = being_get_modified_attribute(being, ATTR_AGI)
    elseif attribute == ATTR_HP_REGEN then
        local hp_per_sec = being_get_modified_attribute(being, ATTR_VIT) * 0.05
        new_base = hp_per_sec * TICKS_PER_HP_REGENERATION / 10
    elseif attribute == ATTR_HP then
        local hp = being_get_modified_attribute(being, ATTR_HP)
        local max_hp = being_get_modified_attribute(being, ATTR_MAX_HP)

        if hp > max_hp then
            new_base = new_base - hp - max_hp
        end
    elseif attribute == ATTR_MAX_HP then
        local vit = being_get_modified_attribute(being, ATTR_VIT)
        new_base = (vit + 3) * (vit + 20) * 0.125
    end

    if new_base ~= old_base then
        being_set_base_attribute(being, attribute, new_base)
    end
end

local function update_derived_attributes(being, attribute)
    if attribute == ATTR_STR then
        recalculate_base_attribute(ATTR_INV_CAPACITY, being)
    elseif attribute == ATTR_AGI then
        recalculate_base_attribute(ATTR_DODGE, being)
    elseif attribute == ATTR_VIT then
        recalculate_base_attribute(ATTR_MAX_HP, being)
        recalculate_base_attribute(ATTR_HP_REGEN, being)
        recalculate_base_attribute(ATTR_DEFENSE, being)
    end
end

on_recalculate_base_attribute(recalculate_base_attribute)
on_update_derived_attribute(update_derived_attributes)
</file>

The script should be pretty self-explanatory. If an attribute is changed
''update_derived_attributes'' is called. That function then checks which
attributes have to get recalculated and recalculates them.

====== Attributes settings ======

Different usable attributes for beings in the game world are configured
in [[settings:settings.xml]] using [[settings:attribute|<attribute>]] tag.
Attribute scopes are typically as being, but monster and character scopes
are available as well.

The attribute types are still hardcoded into the game-server - this file determines how the attribute can be further modified past the base value. 
Calculation of the base value is hardcoded - see the virtual being updateDerivedAttributes() method for details.

Additional (non-core) attributes can be specified in the file, but would have undefined base values (should still be alterable via scripts)

As of a822f8f257aaec37174a11add3543ef70a29e206, the following attributes (and associated ids) are:

^  Attribute name  ^  id  ^
| Strength       | 1  |
| Agility        | 2  |
| Vitality       | 3  |
| Intelligence   | 4  |
| Dexterity      | 5  |
| Willpower      | 6  |
^ ^^
| Accuracy       | 7  |
| Defence        | 8  |
| Dodge          | 9  |
^ ^^
| Magic dodge    | 10 |
| Magic defence  | 11 |

| Bonus aspd     | 12 |

| Hp             | 13 |
| Max hp         | 14 |
| Hp regen       | 15 |
^ ^^
| Movespeed (tps)| 16 |
| Movespeed (raw)| 17 |
| Gp             | 18 |
| Capacity (invy)| 19 |
^ The following are also defined (for mobs only), but are merely temporary until mobs are altered to properly use auto-attacks. ^^
| Physical atk (min)| 20 |
| Physical atk (delta)| 21 |
| Magical atk | 22 |

Up to date definitions can be found in defines.h and in relevant updateDerivedAttributes methods.

Here is an example of an attributes.xml file:
It is recommended to use exactly this file for now: [[https://github.com/mana/manaserv/blob/master/example/attributes.xml|attributes reference file]]
