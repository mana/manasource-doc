====== Special Overview ======
Specials in Manaserv are special attacks or abillities by characters that are actively triggered by the player. For example magic spells, special attacks or specific actions of the character can be implemented using specials.

====== specials.xml Documentation ======

The specials.xml file is used to set up the different special moves and capacity used by the player while in game.

**Warning: WIP** Currently, the implementation isn't fully tested. Feel free to [[mantis_workflow|report bug in our mantis]].

Here is an example of a specials.xml file:

<file xml specials.xml>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<specials>
    <special-set name="Magic">
        <special
            id="1"
            name="Test Spell 1"
            rechargeable="true"
            needed="100"
            rechargespeed="10"
            icon="icons/spell_1.png"
        />
        <special
            id="2"
            name="Test Spell 2"
            rechargeable="true"
            needed="1000"
            rechargespeed="10"
            target="being"
            icon="icons/spell_2.png"
        />
    </special-set>
</specials>
</file>

====== A script example ======
Here is an example special. It implements a heal spell that can heal other people or yourself.
The example also shows how it is possible to link the specials to [[skills.xml|skills]].

First the needed entry in the [[specials.xml#specials.xml Documentation|specials.xml]]:
<file xml specials.xml>
        <!-- ... -->
        <special
            id="4"
            name="Heal"
            rechargeable="true"
            needed="17500"
            rechargespeed="175"
        />
        <!-- ... -->
</file>

Then the definition in the [[skills.xml]]. This is of course *only* needed if you want to link the special to a skill. This is not directly needed for specials. It is only needed in this example.
<file xml skills.xml>
    <!-- ... -->
    <set name="Magic">
        <!-- ... -->
        <skill id="203" name="Heal"
            icon="icons/spell_heal.png"/>
        <!-- ... -->
    </set>
    <!-- ... -->
</file>

And finally the lua script (see the [[scripting#Special info class|scripting documentation]] for more info):
<file lua heal.lua>
local skill_name = "Magic_Heal"
local heal = 20
local range = 6 * TILESIZE

-- Here we get the special info by the name (<setname>_<specialname>)
-- For getting it by id simply use the id instead of a string.
local spell = get_special_info("Magic_Heal")
spell:on_use(function(user, target, special_id)
    -- Either target a player or if no target is selected the user
    target = target or user
    if being_type(target) ~= TYPE_CHARACTER and target ~= user then
        return
    end 

    local heal_mod = heal * get_special_factor(user, skill_name)

    -- Spawn a effect on the target
    effect_create(11, target)
    
    -- Calculate the effect of heal
    local current_hp = being_get_modified_attribute(target, ATTR_HP)
    local max_hp = being_get_modified_attribute(target, ATTR_MAX_HP)

    heal_mod = math.min(heal_mod, max_hp - current_hp)
    local gained_exp = math.floor(heal_mod / 10) 

    -- Stop since nothing would be healed
    if heal_mod == 0 then
        return
    end 
    
    -- Actually do the healing
    being_set_base_attribute(target, ATTR_HP, current_hp + heal_mod)

    -- No exp for self heal
    if target ~= user then
        -- This gives the player XP for the Heal skill.
        -- As mentioned before, linking with skills if of course fully optional and not required.
        chr_give_exp(user, skill_name, gained_exp)
    end

    -- Consume the mana --> Force the special to recharge
    chr_set_special_mana(user, special_id, 0)
end)
</file>

So the structure of a special generally looks like this:
<file lua minimalspecial.lua>
-- Here we get the special info by the name (<setname>_<specialname>)
-- For getting it by id simply use the id instead of a string.
local spell = get_special_info("setname_specialname")
spell:on_use(function(user, target, special_id)

    -- Define the effect of the special here!

    -- Consume the mana --> Force the special to recharge
    chr_set_special_mana(user, special_id, 0)
end)
</file>
