The Mana server uses the scripting language LUA for scripting. This is a list
of the script commands currently implemented in addition to the
[[http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/|standard lua statements and functions]].

Also, if you want to look at actual working samples, you can have a look at the
''example/scripts'' folder in the
[[https://github.com/mana/manaserv/tree/master/example/scripts|Manaserv's source]]
which has always the latest working set.
