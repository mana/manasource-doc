The Mana server uses the scripting language LUA for scripting. This is a list of the script commands currently implemented in addition to the [[http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/|standard lua statements and functions]].

Also, if you want to look at actual working samples, you can have a look at the ''example/serverdata/scripts'' folder in the [[https://github.com/mana/manaserv/tree/master/example/serverdata/scripts|Manaserv's source]] which has always the latest working set.
