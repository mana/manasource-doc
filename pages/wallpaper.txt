===== Wallpapers handling =====

The background wallpapers are shown at client startup and are handled by the client in a specific way.

==== Default Paths and files ====

The different usable wallpaper paths will be searched in that order:
  - From the ''wallpapersPath'' in the [[branding.xml]] file if there is one and if some fitting files are found there,
  - From the ''wallpapers'' options isn't set in the [[settings:settings.xml]] file if there is one and if some fitting files are found there,
  - In the ''graphics/images/'' otherwise.

The default wallpaper file will be searched in that order:
  - From the ''wallpaperFile'' in the [[branding.xml]] file if there is a fitting file found at the path+file location,
  - From the ''wallpaperFile'' options isn't set in the [[settings:settings.xml]] file if there is a fitting file found at the path+file location,
  - As ''graphics/images/login_wallpaper.png'' otherwise.

==== Wallpapers options ====

=== Link a wallpaper to a minimum resolution ===

In order to get a nice wallpaper whatever the resolution the users will use, the wallpapers' filename endings
can use the given pattern:
  myWallpaper_<Screen Width>x<Screen Height>.png

E.g.: A wallpaper to be used **at the minimum** 800x600 screen resolution will end with ''_800x600.png''.
This means that the given wallpaper file will be used at 800x600 and higher resolutions, but not when starting the client with a resolution of 640x480, for instance.

=== Display wallpapers randomly ===

More than this, if more than one wallpaper file fitting a given minimum resolution is found. One of them will be loaded randomly when starting the client.

E.g.: With the given files:
  myWallpaper1_800x600.png
  myWallpaper2_800x600.png
  myWallpaper1_1024x768.png
  myWallpaper1_1440x900.png

  * The client have only the default ''login_wallpaper.png'' file available for a resolution of 640x480,
  * 2 files ending with _800x600.png for the resolution of 800x600,
  * 3 files for the resolution of 1024x768, ...
