======= settings.xml - The <map> tag =======

The ''<map>'' tag is used to assign each map file (files with ''.tmx'' or ''.tmx.gz'' extension - [[http://www.mapeditor.org|Tiled map editor]] format) a unique ID, used by both the game and account server.

Each ''<map>'' node must have two required parameters:

^  Parameter name  ^  Type  ^  Mandatory  ^ Description  ^
|  id  |  integer  |  yes  | The map id used by both the account and the game server. Note that the id must be unique, and one of them has to correspond to the ''char_startMap'' and ''respawnMap'' id values in the [[:manaserv.xml]] file.  |
|  name  |  string  |  yes  | The name of the map file to be used when calling data with the corresponding the map ID. The filename is to be given without the file extension (''.tmx'' or ''.tmx.gz''), and is relative to the ''data/maps'' directory.  |
|  servername  |  string  |  no  | The name of the server that is supposed to handle this map. |

Go back to [[settings.xml]].
