====== The settings.xml file ======

Since Mana 0.7, the `settings.xml` file defines all the settings for the game.
It replaces the predefined files that were used before, like `npcs.xml`,
`monsters.xml`, `items.xml`, etc. The new format allows including arbitrary
additional files, which gives total freedom of the structure of the settings.
The meaning of each node is based on the name of its tag.


===== The root tag =====

Due to compatibility issues, the name of the root tag is not checked.
For compatibility with older games and tmwAthena, the meaning of some tags
depends on the name of the root tag (this is the case for the <set> tag which
has different meaning depending if it is inside <skills> or <specials> tag).

You should use <settings> as the root tag when creating new settings file,
as all other names will generate a warning in future release (and maybe
someday an error will be thrown).
