{% include toc.md %}
the Mana server, as a MMORPG server, will need rather a lot of different data. Depending on their scope, the data can used by the server, the client or both.
Maintainers usually tend to put data used by both in the client data along with the rest, and have the server points to it using the `clientDataPath` option from [manaserv.xml](manaserv.xml.html).

The following section will now attempt to describe what data is useful where, and why.

#  Required data

##  Data used only by the servers

The server requires only a few configuration files, located at the path corresponding to the `serverDataPath` manaserv.xml value.

        <tr>
            <th>File</th>

            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
